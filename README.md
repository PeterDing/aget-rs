`aget-rs` is a fast asynchronous downloader wrote with Rust.  
It requests a resource with a number of concurrent asynchronous request in a single thread.

Especially, the concurrent amount can be any positive number as your wish.

`aget-rs` supports to download a **HTTP/S** link and a **M3U8** video link.

## Dependences

Aget-rs needs `openssl > 1.0.2g`

## Installation

You can download the last release from https://github.com/PeterDing/aget-rs/releases

## Benchmark

We conside that there is a file to download. This file has 10MB.
The server which hosts the file has been set a limit rate to 100KB/s, but no connecting count limit.

It will be easy to calculate the total costing time when we use 1, 10, 100 connections to request the file.

In the benchmark test, we use `nginx` to simulate the environment where a limit rate is 100KB/s for downloading.

Following is the results of using `curl` and `aget-rs`. (For more details, you can find at [here](ci/benchmark.bash))

- One connection using `curl`

  ```
  time curl http://localhost:9010/abc
    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                   Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  100 10.0M  100 10.0M    0     0   100k      0  0:01:42  0:01:42 --:--:--  103k
  real	1m42.147s
  user	0m0.021s
  sys	0m0.035s
  ```

  **time cost: 102s**

- 10 connections using `aget-rs`

  ```
  time ag http://localhost:9010/abc -s 10 -k 1m
      File: abc
    Length: 10.0M (10485760)
  10.0M/10.0M 100.00% NaNG/s eta: 0s        [==================================>] 
  real	0m10.016s
  user	0m0.040s
  sys	0m0.020s
  ```

  **time cost: 10s, 10 times faster than curl**

- 100 connections using `aget-rs`

  ```
  time ag http://localhost:9010/abc -s 100 -k 103k
      File: abc
    Length: 10.0M (10485760)
  10.0M/10.0M 100.00% NaNG/s eta: 0s        [==================================>] 
  real	0m2.016s
  user	0m0.087s
  sys	0m0.029s
  ```

  **time cost: 2s, 50 times faster than curl**


## Usage

- Request a resource with default configuration

   The default concurrent amount is `10` and chunk length is `1m`.

   ```shell
   ag http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/18.10/release/ubuntu-18.10-server-amd64.iso
   ```

- Set concurrent amount and chunk length

   Use `-s` or `--concurrent` to set the number of concurrent request.  
   Use `-k` or `--chunk-size` to set the chunk length of each request.  
   `--chunk-size` takes a literal size description, example `1k` for one Kilobyte,  
   `2m` for two Megabyte, `1g` for Gigabyte.  

   ```shell
   ag "url of resource" -s 20 -k 1m
   ```

- Set a path for output

   Use `-o` or `--out` to set the path.  
   If the argument is not gave, we take the last part of the url' path as the path.  

   ```shell
   ag "url of resource" -o /path/to/file
   ```

- Set request headers

   Use `-H` to set headers.  

   ```shell
   ag "url of resource" -H "Cookie: key=value" -H "Accept: */*"
   ```

- Set request method and data

   Use `-X` or `--method` to set method for http, example, `GET`, `POST`.  
   The default method is `GET`.  
   With a data, using `-d` or `--data`, example, `a=b`  

   ```shell
   ag "url of resource" -d "a=b"
   ```

## Options

```

    ag [OPTIONS] <URL>

OPTIONS:
    -X, --method <method>              Request method, e.g. GET, POST. [default: GET]
    -H, --header <header>...           Request headers, e.g. -H "User-Agent: aget".
    -d, --data <data>                  Request with POST method with the data, e.g. -d "a=b".

        --quiet                        Quiet mode. Don't show progress bar and task information. But still show the
                                       error information
    -h, --help                         Print this help message.
    -V, --version                      Show version information.

ARGS:
    <URL>    URL to request.
```

## Configuration

Aget can be configured by a configuration file. The file locates at `~/.config/aget/config`.
Following options can be set. Aget uses these options as the defaults for each command.

```toml
headers = [["key", "value"], ...]
concurrency = ...
chunk-size = "..."
timeout = ...
dns-timeout = ...
retries = ...
retry-wait = ...
```

If the file does not exist, aget will use the default configuration.

```toml
headers = [["user-agent", "aget/version"]]
concurrency = 10
chunk-size = "50m"
timeout = 60
dns-timeout = 10
retries = 5
retry-wait = 0
```
